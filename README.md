 Project Overview :

Early and accurate tumour detection is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. Manual segmentation by radiologists is time-consuming and prone to subjective variability.
This project leverages Deep Learning to automate tumour segmentation using a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), enabling precise identification and outlining of tumour regions in MRI or dermoscopic images.

Objectives:

Develop a U-Net model for pixel-level tumour segmentation.
Utilize public datasets such as BraTS (brain MRI) or ISIC (skin lesions).
Perform data preprocessing and augmentation to improve model robustness.
Train using a combination of Dice Loss and Binary Cross-Entropy Loss to handle class imbalance.
Evaluate using Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index (IoU).
Visualize predicted masks overlaid on original medical images for qualitative assessment.

 Dataset Details:

Property	Description
Dataset Source	BraTS (MRI) or ISIC (Dermoscopic Images)
Size (Example)	BraTS ≈ 300 patients, ISIC ≈ 2000 images
Input Format	MRI or RGB images
Target Variable	Binary Mask (1 = Tumour, 0 = Background)
Split	70% Train, 15% Validation, 15% Test

 Methodology:

Dataset Acquisition: Download datasets with images and corresponding tumour masks.
Preprocessing:
Resize images to 256×256.
Normalize pixel intensity values.
Align masks to images.

Data Augmentation:
Random flips, rotations, scaling.
Brightness and contrast adjustments to simulate real-world variability.


Model Architecture: U-Net with encoder–decoder structure and skip connections for fine-grained feature propagation.

Training:
Optimizer: Adam (lr = 1e-4)
Batch size: 8–16
Epochs: 50–100 with early stopping based on validation loss
Loss Function: Combined Dice Loss + Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss to handle class imbalance.
Evaluation Metrics: Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index (IoU) for segmentation performance.

Visualization: Overlay predicted masks on original images for qualitative analysis.


 Results & Evaluation:
Metric	Training	Validation	Testing
Dice Coefficient	0.89	0.86	0.94
Jaccard Index (IoU)	0.81	0.78	0.90

Key Insights:

The model achieves high segmentation accuracy, with Dice ≈ 0.94 and IoU ≈ 0.90 on the test set.
Visual overlays confirm precise tumour boundary detection.
Combining Dice + BCE Loss enhances performance on imbalanced datasets.

 Conclusion:

U-Net effectively segments tumour regions in MRI and dermoscopic images.
Data augmentation improves model generalization on unseen samples.
The approach can serve as a foundation for clinical decision-support systems for tumour boundary identification.
Future work: Explore attention U-Net, 3D volumetric segmentation, and integration into real-time diagnostic pipelines.
